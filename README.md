<b>Why I started this project:</b><br>
I liked using letterloop, but I didn't want to pay the annual / monthly subscription.
I wanted to create a rudimentary version to practice using javascript to create elements, add classes and ids to them, and add event listeners.
<br><br>

<b>Note: This project is this in progress!</b><br>

<b>Goal:</b><br>
Create a letterloop clone that has:
<ul>- An input paired with a submit button where the users can submit questions</ul>
<ul>- Upon submitting a question (clicking the submit button) create a new HTML element that displays the question</ul>
<ul>- Create a username input and an answer input with a submit button</ul>
<ul>- When users hit the submit button, their username and corresponding answer will be displayed in a paragraph below the question</ul>
<ul>- Have a comment button for each answer</ul>
<ul>- When you click the comment button, it should create another username and answer input with a submit button</ul>
<ul>- Pull the text from those username and comment inputs and create a paragraph to display them beneath the corresponding answer</ul>
<br><br>

<b>What I learned</b><br>
<ul>- Containers can be tricky! Keep track of what's going within what. Drawings help.</ul>
<ul>- You can't append paragraphs and inputs to a button</ul>
<br><br>

<b>How I could improve this project:</b><br>
<ul>- Add more CSS styling so it's easier to differentiate questions from the answers and the comments from the answers</ul>
<ul>- Make a throw error if the input fields are empty when you click the corresponding submit button</ul>
<ul>- Add username and password functionality - think this would require some more advanced knowledge of data storage</ul>
<ul>- Make it so there's separate HTML pages per month where each Q&A "issue" is stored and create a navigation bar or dropdown hamburger to toggle between the pages</ul>
